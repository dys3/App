What will your final demo look like?<br/>
Describe the flow of your final demo<br/>
After logging into the app, the user goes to the home screen that shows the upcoming events. The user can click the events and check the profile of the events. Then the user finds he has a event coming up in 30 mins with his friends at Westfield UTC, so he decides to go now. When he drives to UTC, he opens the map screen and sees one of the friends is at the parking strcuture too, so he finds his friends easily. Also, they see many of their friends are at Starbusks so they decide to meet them all at Starbucks. Then the user recieves a message from his friend saying that she will be late. When they come to the event, they find many new people so they search them on the searching screen and see their profiles and add some new friends.<br/>
