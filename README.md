Start with a problem statement and follow up with a solution.
Focus on engaging your audience with a relatable need.
The biggest struggles when meeting up with friends is finding our friends. It is not always easy to find your friends and we always end up losing precious hang out time. 
When using WhereUAt, you and your friends' location will be showed and shared on the app so that it will save a lot of time by avoiding spending time on finding your friends.

What screens will each user see?
The core function is to help people to see the location of their firends who are going to the same event with them. They will see a map screen to see the locations of their friends (as pins), a profile screen, a searching sreen to add friends, an event screen and a chatting screen, a home screen.

What will your final demo look like?
Describe the flow of your final demo
After logging into the app, the user goes to the home screen that shows the upcoming events. The user can click the events and check the profile of the events. Then the user finds he has a event coming up in 30 mins with his friends at Westfield UTC, so he decides to go now. When he drives to UTC, he opens the map screen and sees one of the friends is at the parking strcuture too, so he finds his friends easily. Also, they see many of their friends are at Starbusks so they decide to meet them all at Starbucks. Then the user recieves a message from his friend saying that she will be late. When they come to the event, they find many new people so they search them on the searching screen and see their profiles and add some new friends.
